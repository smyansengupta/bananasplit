-- Availability moves off "User" into its own, owner-only table
-- =====================================================================
-- "When can't you meet?" (profile setup A5) was a column on "User". Every
-- member of an org the user belongs to may SELECT that row (0B policy), so
-- the rule labels ("Therapy", "Second job") were private only because the
-- app never selected them. Now the database says so:
--
--   UserAvailability   one row per user; app_user reads and writes only
--                      its own row (userId = app.user_id()).
--     rules            the grid and the labelled rules. Never leaves the
--                      owner's own transactions.
--     busy             the "day-hour" cells busy in a typical week, derived
--                      from rules by the app on every save.
--   app.member_busy_hours(user)
--                      the one way another member sees anything: the busy
--                      cells alone, only when both are members of the
--                      caller's current org, and only when that org shares
--                      busy times (OrgSettings.showMemberAvailability) or
--                      the caller is one of its admins.
--
-- The feature has not shipped, so the copy below only matters for branch
-- databases; busy is rebuilt from rules on the next save.

-- =====================================================================
-- WorkOS AuthKit issues the OAuth tokens an AI app (Claude, ChatGPT,
-- Cursor, VS Code) presents at /api/mcp. Our own record of each connection
-- lives here, and it is what decides: WorkOS has no revocation endpoint and
-- no grant webhooks, so every MCP request checks its row.
--
--   ConnectorGrant      one per user and OAuth client: the consent the
--                       current tokens belong to (the token's sid), read
--                       or read-and-change, one space or all of them, and
--                       revokedAt (Disconnect, a password reset, the Google
--                       sign-in gate). app_user reads and writes only its
--                       own rows ("userId" = app.user_id()).
--   OrgSettings.connectorsEnabled
--                       the club switch (Admin panel › Privacy › AI
--                       connectors), on by default for new and existing
--                       clubs. Its UPDATE is already owner/admin-only.
--   app.connector_spaces()
--                       the caller's spaces with their switch, in one
--                       call: OrgSettings is readable only in the current
--                       org, and list_spaces and /connect need every club's.
--   app.revoke_connector_grants(user)
--                       the identity plane's revoke (app_auth only): a
--                       password reset and the Google gate's password strip
--                       revoke every live grant in their own transaction.

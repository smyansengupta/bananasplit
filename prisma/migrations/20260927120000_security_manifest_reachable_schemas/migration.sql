-- The security manifest checks objects only where a runtime role can reach
-- them.
--
-- Production runs on Supabase. A Supabase project ships schemas that
-- Supabase owns and manages (auth, storage, realtime, extensions,
-- graphql_public, pgbouncer). app.security_manifest() scanned every
-- non-system schema, so on the new project /api/health answered 503 on 59
-- rows, all about Supabase's own objects: RLS off on auth.oauth_*,
-- auth.mfa_*, realtime.subscription and the like, PUBLIC EXECUTE on their
-- functions, and pgbouncer.get_auth()'s search_path. None of it is
-- reachable: app_user, app_service and app_auth have no USAGE on any of
-- those schemas. "Fixing" the rows would mean altering objects Supabase
-- owns and manages, and a drift guard that is always red teaches everyone
-- to ignore it.
--
-- What "reachable" means. A role finds an object by name only with USAGE
-- on its schema, but a name is not the only way in. A reachable object can
-- lead somewhere else with no USAGE check at all:
--   - a view (security_invoker checks the caller's privileges on the
--     tables it reads, but the names were resolved when it was created, so
--     schema USAGE is never checked again);
--   - a column default, CHECK constraint, index expression, policy or
--     trigger on a reachable table that calls a function in another schema;
--   - an operator or a type whose function lives in another schema;
--   - a cast, which lives in no schema at all.
-- So the scope is a closure over pg_depend. Start from every relation,
-- function, type and operator in a schema some runtime role has USAGE on
-- (has_schema_privilege, which counts PUBLIC and role membership), plus
-- every cast. Add whatever a reached object depends on, and the parts of a
-- reached object (its view rule, defaults, constraints, indexes, triggers,
-- policies and partitions: its auto and internal dependents). Repeat. The
-- closure never steps into a schema itself: reaching one object in a
-- schema does not put the rest of that schema in scope.
--
-- Event triggers are the other way in. They fire on any role's DDL, a
-- runtime role's included (ddl_command_start fires before the command's
-- own permission checks, and ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE <self> is
-- DDL every role may run), and a SECURITY DEFINER event-trigger function
-- then runs as its owner. Supabase's public.rls_auto_enable() is one. So
-- every event-trigger function stays in definer_search_path wherever it
-- lives. Not in public_execute: an event-trigger function cannot be called,
-- only fired, and firing never checks EXECUTE.
--
-- Scoped to the closure (they describe how an object is set up):
--   rls_disabled, view_not_invoker, matview_or_foreign_granted, policy_gap,
--   permissive_policy, public_execute, and definer_search_path (plus every
--   event-trigger function).
-- Still over every non-system schema (they describe the runtime roles, and
-- only this repository grants anything to them):
--   role_attribute, role_membership, owns_objects (anything, anywhere),
--   temp_privilege;
--   schema_create: CREATE is dangerous without USAGE. Creating an object
--     needs only CREATE (RLS case T27k2), and a function or table planted in
--     a schema on another role's search_path is picked up by that role,
--     which does have USAGE;
--   dangerous_privilege: TRUNCATE (which bypasses RLS), TRIGGER or
--     REFERENCES held by a runtime role is the mistake wherever the table
--     sits, and it goes live the moment the schema gains USAGE.
-- Unchanged: tenant_only_write reads the public policies with b9's
-- allowlist; public._prisma_migrations and extension members are skipped
-- as before; SECURITY INVOKER (it reads world-readable catalogs only), the
-- search_path, and EXECUTE for app_service only. New: SET jit = off (see
-- the function).
--
-- Holes considered:
--   - A SECURITY DEFINER function in a reachable schema that reads an
--     unreachable one is itself in scope, so public_execute and
--     definer_search_path still apply to it, and RLS case T27c pins the
--     list of definer functions. The manifest never read function bodies.
--   - An invoker function's body resolves names when it runs, as the
--     caller, so it needs USAGE like any query. SQL-standard bodies (BEGIN
--     ATOMIC) record dependencies and are followed anyway.
--   - A schema that later gains USAGE: the scope is computed from the live
--     catalogs on every call. Nothing names a Supabase schema and no list is
--     stored, so the GRANT puts every object in the schema in scope in the
--     same transaction (RLS case T27j; T27l covers the closure, T27m the
--     event triggers).
--   - A new schema of ours whose migration forgets the USAGE grant goes
--     unchecked, and is equally unreachable, until the grant the app needs
--     arrives with it.
--   - Inheritance children (not partitions) are not followed: reading the
--     parent reads them under the parent's privileges and policies.

-- SET jit = off: the recursive term's cost estimate is high enough to
-- trigger JIT compilation, which took the call from about 25 ms to over a
-- second on a migrated database, on every /api/health request.
